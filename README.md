[A] Pattern pre-processing algorithms

(1)  Smoothing and cleaning algorithms
Smoothing is used to straighten the edges and remove noises from an image. Smoothing and noise removal can be done by a filtering mask, where using an algorithm, the output image is determined by matching values of the pixels in the neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel with the selected filter mask. Single pixel noises and one pixel wide noises can be removed using smoothing.

Smoothing using 3x3 linear filter mask

Algorithm: 
Input: 
	A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Binary Matrix’ with binary values (0, 1) from Binary Image
	A 2 dimensional array of integers, ‘Filter Mask’ with 4 filter values
[ = , = , = ]	[ x , = , = ]	[ x , x , x ]	[ = , = , x ]
[ = , T , = ]	[ x , T , = ]	[ = , T , = ]	[ = , T , x ]
[ x , x ,  x ]	[ x , = , = ]	[ = , = , = ]	[ = , = , x ]

Output: A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Result Matrix’ with pixels matching the smoothing condition of 3x3 filter mask with filter value 4.

pixelChange <- false 
    for each pixel from lower right corner of Binary Matrix
target <- pixel in the center of Binary Matrix
 if neighbors of target pixel are aligned with ‘=’ in the Filter Mask
	set target<- match the pixel value denoted by ‘=’
	pixelChange<- true
end if
	       end for
    return Result Matrix

							      Filter

 
INPUT: Image 9				OUTPUT:  Image 9 after smoothing using 3x3

(2) Filling: 4 Neighbors filling 

4 Neighbors Filling algorithm is used to fill the pixels which are blank in the image with the 4 immediate neighbors (East, West, North, and South) of Target Pixel. 4 Neighbors filling uses its immediate neighbors for the filling of pixels.ie, if Target pixels immediate 3 neighbors (East or West or North or South) are filled, then the Target pixel is filled else the Target pixel is not changed.

for each pixel from upper left corner of Binary Matrix
Target Pixel <- pixel in the center of Binary Matrix
Left Pixel <- left pixel adjacent to the Target Pixel
Right Pixel <- right pixel adjacent to the Target Pixel
Upper Pixel <- Upper pixel adjacent to the Target Pixel 
Lower Pixel <- lower pixel adjacent to the Target Pixel

Target Pixel <-  Target Pixel || ( Upper Pixel & Lower Pixel & ( Left Pixel | 
Right Pixel ) ) || ( Left Pixel & Right Pixel & ( Upper Pixel | Lower Pixel ) ) ;

return Result Matrix

(2) Filling: 8 neighbors filling 

8 Neighbors Filling algorithm is used to fill the pixels which are blank in the image with the 4 immediate neighbors (East, West, North, and South) and 4 diagonal neighbors (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest) of Target Pixel. 8 Neighbors filling uses its diagonal neighbors for the filling of pixels.ie, if Target pixels diagonal pixels are filled then the Target pixel is filled else the Target pixel is not changed.

[A] (ii) Normalization

Size Normalization: The goal of the size normalization is to reduce the shape of the original image to a standard pre-defined size. Image length and width are reduced to a standard pane with a pre-defined length and width. 
Using linear normalization method, width and height (W1 and H1) of original character is reduced normalized image size (W2 and H2).Using backward mapping process, From left top corner of Image each pixel is scanned and index of each pixel is multiplied with the normalization ratio(alpha – length, beta- Width) and the pixel index is set.


Algorithm:
Input: A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Binary Matrix’ with binary values (0, 1) from 8 neighbors filling process

Output: A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Normalized Result Matrix’ with Normalized row size and Normalized Column size, after the Size Normalization

Set:
Alpha <- Normalization ratio for length of the Binary Image
Beta   <- Normalization ratio for breadth of the Binary Image 
for each X value from upper corner of Binary Matrix
    for each Y value from upper corner of Binary Matrix
	X’ Index <-  X Index / Alpha
	Y’ Index <-  Y Index / Beta
	Result Matrix( X’ Index, Y’ Index) <- Binary Matrix( X Index, Y Index)
    end for
end for
return Result Matrix

[A] (III) Center of Gravity

	Center of Gravity is the point around which the black pixels (1’s in binary image) is equally distributed.
	Center of Gravity can be calculated by sum of the pixels in the region each multiplied by its value, divided by the sum of these values.

0	1	0
1	COG	1
0	1	0







Algorithm:
Input: A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Binary Matrix’ with binary values (0, 1) 

Output: A Pixel(X Index, Y Index) which denotes the center of gravity for the Binary Image

Set: X Index Sum <- 0
        Y Index Sum <- 0
        Pixel Count   <- 0
for each X value from upper corner of Binary Matrix
    for each Y value from upper corner of Binary Matrix
	if Binary Matrix(X, Y) is a true
		set: X Index Sum = X Index Sum + X
		        Y Index Sum = Y Index Sum + Y
		Increment Pixel Count
	end if
   end for
end for
  COG X Index = X Index Sum / Pixel Count
  COG Y Index = Y Index Sum / Pixel Count
return Pixel( COG X Index, COG Y Index)

(B) Skeleton extraction
Skeletonizing is a process for reducing foreground regions (number of 1's) in a binary image to a skeletal remnant that largely preserves the extent and connectivity of the original region (binary image of size 1) while removing most of the original foreground pixels.
 
Zhang-Suen Skeletonizing
	This skeletonizing algorithm repeatedly removes foreground pixels from a region in a binary image until skeletal remnant is present. Zhang-Suen Skeletonizing uses two iterations algorithm to remove the foreground pixels. The 1st pass checks for the 8-neighbors of target pixel, which uses southeast boundary and northwest corner point and checks if the pixel can be removed without disturbing the ideal skeleton. The 2nd pass uses the same procedure from northwest boundary points and southeast corner pixel. Iterations are done until there are no changes of pixels are detected in the two passes in the binary image.
Algorithm: 
Input: A 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Binary Matrix’ with binary values (0, 1) from Size Normalization
Output: 1 pixel size width skeletonized 2 dimensional array of integer, ‘Result Matrix’
